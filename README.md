 LA Mini Project code work

A repository containing my Project work related to Linear Algebra.
There is a matrix.py file that defines a matrix class which provides matrix storage and manipulation functions, which you are free to use.
More information is in the usage instructions file.

There is another file that actually contains a few lines to demonstrate what the class does.

One might use NumPY instead, but this class was defined in an attempt to learn.
