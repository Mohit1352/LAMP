 LA Mini Project code work

A repository containing my Project work related to Linear Algebra.
There is a matrix.py file that defines a matrix class which provides matrix storage and manipulation functions, which you ae free to use.
More information is in the usage instructions file.

There is another file that actually contains our implementation of the functions to perform a task - encryption and decryption using matrices.
